# About

example

The Bike Pit! is a free (community) hub for folks whose livelihoods go hand(lebar) in hand with bicycles. We offer programs that create an opportunity to learn about bike maintenance, build community and treat ourselves and each other well. The Bike Pit! works to put radical ideas into practice, such as dismantling oppression, non-hierarchical organizing and collective decision making. We strive to build a fun, welcoming environment that brings people from many communities together to share in this common goal.

The bike industry crafts a culture of disposable goods, gatekeeper knowledge and resource depletion. It alienates people on the basis of socioeconomic, language, age, gender, and other barriers. We hope to create an inclusive alternative to this culture in which bikes, and the ability to care for them, are for everyone.

Because, a bike can change someone's life: it is the ability to move freely and quickly through the city using one's own power. Bikes allow us greater self-sufficiency while weaning us from oppressive systems and wasteful industries. They contribute to physical, mental, and environmental health. Bicycles give us wings!
