# Volunteer

To start volunteering at the Bike Pit just come by the shop during open hours, come to our next meeting, or come to collective training! 
Volunteers enjoy most of the benefits of collective membership except for the fancy title of "collective member," which just means you can have more of a say in decisions made for the Bike Pit.

To become a collective member of the Bike Pit, you must meet the following criteria:

* You have been to the shop several times during regular shop hours.
* You have gone through our volunteer training or plan to go through volunteer training.
* You want to help spread bike love and knowledge!

Collective members commit to running at least one [program](/schedule/#programs) on a regular basis.

You can be involved at the Bike Pit in any capacity you want. We always need more committed volunteers and value the input of everyone involved.
