# Task List

The following are some of the things we need help with every day. If you want to help, this list is a good place to start. 

* Greet people

* Patch tubes

* Strip bikes

* Sort bike parts

* Wash dishes

* Sweep floors

Help with any of the above is very much appreciated. If you have done any of the above and want to get more involved, [volunteering](/participate/volunteer.html) could be the next step!
