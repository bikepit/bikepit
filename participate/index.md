# Participate

A very special aspect of the Bike Pit, is that it is run entirely by __volunteers__.

__Want to get involved?__

If so, there are several ways to do so. You can...

* __Help with our daily [task list](/participate/tasks.html)__.  
This is a good place to start if you are new to the space.
These are various tasks that we need help with daily. If something in particular interests you, but you are unsure of how to do it, just ask
and a volunteer will gladly show you.
* __Became a [volunteer](/participate/volunteer.html)__.  
Once you have been to the shop a few times and enjoyed yourself, becoming a volunteer may be the next step. Volunteers have access to the shop during non-standard hours, participate in collective decision making, and make this space possible. Volunteers usually commit to staffing a program of their choice on a regular basis. The rewards are many, and you will make some great friends along the way!

* __Donate to the space__  
We accept monetary donations to help us pay rent on the space, as well as keeping hard-to-salvage materials in stock. We also accept bicycles and bicycle parts.
