# Participate

A very special aspect of the Bike Pit, is that it is run entirely by __volunteers__.

__Want to get involved?__

If so, there are several ways to do so. You can...

* Help with our daily [shop task list](/participate/tasks)
* Donate to the space
* Became a [volunteer](/participate/volunteer)

## Donate

We accept monetary donations to help us pay rent on the space, as well as keeping hard-to-salvage materials in stock. We also accept bicycles and bicycle parts.
