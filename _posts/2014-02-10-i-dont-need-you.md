***

In rejection of the white/cis/male dominated capitalist punk culture. In favor of glittery, fabulous queer love and dance parties!

Unapologetic and Unashamed! Belt out your favorite tunes. Do a classic cover or reinvent the songs you love. Liked a song but then realized it was problematic? Change the lyrics and take that shit back!

This space is prioritizing queers, women and trans folks, people of colour, and all those that are underrepresented and alienated from the music scene. Lets build our own beats to break down barriers and help create a music scene that aims to be safe, inclusive and empowering. Have no shame in your skill level. You can do it!

__ALL AGES!__
