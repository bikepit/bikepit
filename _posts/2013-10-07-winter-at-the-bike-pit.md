Winter is coming, and we will be starting a new schedule in November. We will be open Mondays and Tuesdays only.
 
| Date                  | Time   | What                                         |
|-----------------------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| Mondays               | 4-8 PM | [Fix-a-Bike](#fix)                           |
| Tuesdays              | 4-7 PM | [Women and Trans Shop Hours](#womenandtrans) |
| Last Tuesday          | 3-7 PM | [Build-a-Bike](#build)                       |
