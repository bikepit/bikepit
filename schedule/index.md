# Programs

The following are the programs we host at the Bike Pit. All programs are staffed by volunteers. Participation in the programs and materials are free of charge.

<a id="fix"></a>

## Fix-A-Bike
Whatever ails your bike, fix it here! 
Participants can use our tools and work on their 
own, or learn from one of our volunteer 
mechanics. All cyclists are welcome, but because 
we have limited space, resources and energy, we 
must prioritize bikes that are used for 
transportation and people who have difficulty 
accessing commercial bike shops for whatever 
reason. Please understand that we may not be able 
to accommodate cosmetic or other non-essential 
bike projects on a busy day. But we would love to 
help you to the best of our abilities on a day when 
things are slower! Also, we do not have tools or 
parts for some projects, like single-speed/fixed
gear conversions or working on higher end and 
specialty components.

_Every Monday 4-8pm and Friday noon-4pm_

***

<a id="build"></a>

## Build-A-Bike
No bike? No cash? No problem! During 
our build-a-bike program, folks without bikes can 
work with one of our mechanics to select and 
repair one of the bikes from our yard. All bikes 
are free, of course, so we ask that you use this 
program only if you don't have the resources to 
get a bike in another way. At the start of shop 
hours, names will be entered into a lottery, and 
the selected participants will build bikes on a first 
name pulled, first served basis. Because we have 
limited resources, we can build only one bike per 
person each year.

_First Thursday of each month 3-7PM_

## Women and Trans Shop Hours <a id="womenandtrans"></a>
A time for trans* and female identified folks 
(anyone that identifies within the transgender and/
or gender-variant umbrella) to build and fix bikes. 
Our culture has built a lot of artificial gender 
barriers around access to bikes and mechanical 
skills, so this is a safer, comfortable space for 
trans* and female people to build and share these 
skills together. Because of the nature of gender-
based oppression, we ask that cis-gender men 
(male people whose identified sex matches the sex 
that they were assigned at birth) not attend these 
shop hours, and instead check out our regular fix 
or build times.

_Every Tuesday 4-7PM_

***

<a id="youth"></a>

## Youth Day
Builds and fixes for young people! Young 
people often lack resources that older folks take 
for granted: the money, transportation or freedom 
to take a bike to a commercial shop; the tools 
or parts to work on their bikes at home, or even 
people to seriously answer their questions about 
how stuff works. These shop hours will encourage 
youth to learn to work on their own bikes, and in 
turn share those skills with others. We appreciate 
that some adults are uncomfortable leaving their 
child unattended, but we respectfully ask that 
older folks wait in our seating area or outside while 
the younger folks work on their own bikes (under 
volunteer supervision.) Also, adults â€“ most of our 
other programs are well suited to help you, please 
respect our youth and let them have this shop time 
to themselves.

_Second Sunday of each month 11-2PM_

***

We place a strong emphasis on developing bicycle maintenance skills. Volunteer mechanics are there to provide instruction and guidance, so __be prepared to work on your own bike__!

All programs operate on a first-come, first-serve basis.
